# Create Ecommerce API Using Django And Python
The intention here is to create a web app using Django that tracks calories intake and track the calories consumptions.

## Pre-Requisites
- Python 3.9
- Django

## Steps to run:

- In PipFile, the dependencies are mentioned. It is recommended to run the app inside a virtual environment to avoid conflict of existing dependencies.
  - Create virtualenv for Python 3.9

  - Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
  - 
  - Run the command `./manage.py makemigrations` and `./manage.py migrate` or just use `make migrate` 

  - Run `./manage.py runserver` or `make run` to start the server

  - Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to start

  - Since this is a demo project, the password is written directly in settings.py. For security reasons of your account, it is recommended you store the password in key vault or encrypt it and then host the application or push your changes to GitHub.
